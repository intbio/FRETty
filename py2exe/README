Build instructions:

-- put Microsoft Visual C++ runtime library MSVCP90.dll or it's opensource 
counterpart from wineHQ project to fretty/py2exe directory

-- Uncomment the following line in fretty/py2exe/setup.py if you want to see
console output when application runs:

    console = [{'script': script}],

and comment

#    windows=[{'script':script}],


If console output is off, the warnings should be suppressed in simple_gui.py


-- enter fretty/py2exe directory and run:

>> python setup.py


-- compile setup.nsi script using NSIS (right click on the script file and
select <compile NSIS script> from menu)

-- fretty.exe file should appear in fretty/py2exe directory if everything went
well.
